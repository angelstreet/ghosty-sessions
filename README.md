# Ghosty Sessions

Mobile-first tmux dashboard for the Claude / Codex sessions running on `codebox`.
Streams every `tmux capture-pane` to your phone over Tailscale (1 Hz tick),
lets you send keystrokes back, and shows status pills (idle / busy / needs you).

> Read-mostly, send-keys-when-needed. The terminal stays alive on your laptop;
> Ghosty is a peer, not a replacement.

## Access

- Phone must be on the same Tailscale tailnet as `codebox`.
- **Plain HTTP**: `http://<codebox-tailnet-ip>:7777/` — works, but Chrome won't
  show the "Install" PWA option. Use Chrome menu → "Add to Home Screen".
- **HTTPS (recommended for PWA install)**: `https://<codebox-tailnet-ip>:7443/`
  — accepts a self-signed cert once, after which Chrome treats it as installable
  and the orange ↓ button in the topbar fires the system install prompt.

The server listens on `0.0.0.0:7777` and `0.0.0.0:7443`. It is reached via
`codebox`'s Tailscale IP (typically `100.74.90.82`). The Proxmox firewall on
`vmbr0` does not expose these ports to LAN guests — only tailnet peers can reach them.

## Run on codebox

```bash
cd ~/ghosty-sessions
npm install --omit=dev
sudo ln -sf $PWD/systemd/ghosty-sessions.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now ghosty-sessions
sudo systemctl status ghosty-sessions --no-pager
journalctl -u ghosty-sessions -f
```

If you don't want systemd, just `npm start` in a tmux session — the same `server.js`.

## Configuration

Env vars (defaults shown). The unit sets the non-secret ones and loads the gitignored
`~/ghosty-sessions/.env` for the rest:

```bash
# ~/ghosty-sessions/.env  (chmod 600, never committed)
NTFY_TOPIC=ghosty-codebox-<random>      # subscribe to the same topic in the ntfy phone app
PUBLIC_URL=http://100.74.90.82:7777     # notification tap opens /?s=<session>
```

| var | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT`        | `7777` | listen port |
| `HOST`        | `0.0.0.0` | listen addr (`tailscale0` is the safest) |
| `TICK_MS`     | `1000`  | pane capture cadence |
| `PANE_LINES`  | `1000`  | scrollback lines captured for a session with an open card (a WebSocket viewer); the unit sets 2000 |
| `PANE_LINES_BG` | `300` | scrollback lines for every other session (state, reply and manager only need the tail) |
| `NTFY_TOPIC`  | unset   | enable optional ntfy push (Web Push is always on): a session starts waiting (high), a disk reaches the critical level (urgent, repeated every 6 h). Keep it secret — anyone with the topic name can read it |
| `NTFY_DONE`   | unset   | `1` also pushes when an agent finishes a turn |
| `NTFY_URL`    | `https://ntfy.sh` | ntfy server base URL |
| `PUBLIC_URL`  | unset   | base URL of this app; used as the notification click link (`/?s=<session>`) |
| `HEALTH_MS`   | `5000`  | codebox health sample cadence (CPU, load, RAM, disk) |
| `HEALTH_DISKS`| `/`     | comma-separated mount points shown in the health strip |
| `HEALTH_WARN_PCT` / `HEALTH_CRIT_PCT` | `85` / `95` | amber / red thresholds for CPU, RAM and disk; disk at critical pushes to ntfy. Load is amber at 1x cores, red at 2x |
| `JEV_URL` / `JEV_API_KEY` | unset | AI manager: the VPT server's `POST /server/ai/decide` and its `API_KEY` (Jev for ambiguous stalls). Unset = rules only |
| `JEV_DAILY_USD` / `JEV_DAILY_CALLS` | `0.25` / `2000` | Jev budget per UTC day; over it, ambiguous stalls stay with the owner |
| `STALL_SETTLE_MS` | `5000` | a stopped pane must stay unchanged this long before it counts as a stall |
| `GHOSTY_STATE_DIR` | `~/.local/state/ghosty` | manager config, `stalls.jsonl` log, Jev budget |
| `GHOSTY_FORBIDDEN_EXTRA` | unset | extra regex of never-auto-answer words (customer names etc. — keep them out of the public repo) |
| `DONE_IDLE_HOURS` | `6` | a finished agent session turns `done` -> `idle` after this long |
| `AGENT_CMD_CLAUDE` / `_CODEX` / `_MINIMAX` / `_BASH` | `claude` / `codex` / `minimax-code` / (none) | command typed into a session created via `POST /api/sessions` |

## Web Push (phone notifications, no extra app)

The bell button subscribes the browser / installed Android app (TWA) to Web Push. Alerts - a session
waiting ("needs you"), the manager asking you, a disk reaching critical, optionally "done" - reach the
phone even with the app closed.

- Payload-less push: the server POSTs an empty request signed with a VAPID ES256 key (node:crypto, no
  dependencies) to the browser's push service (FCM on Android). The service worker wakes up and reads
  `GET /api/push/feed?since=<last id>` to learn what to show, then calls `showNotification`. Tapping
  opens `/?s=<session>`.
- Needs a secure context (the https:// address). Notification permission must be allowed for the app.
- State in `$GHOSTY_STATE_DIR` (default `~/.local/state/ghosty`): `vapid.json` (private key, chmod 600,
  never commit), `push-subs.json` (subscriptions; dropped when the push service answers 404/410),
  `push-feed.json` (last 50 alerts).
- Routes: `GET /api/push/key`, `GET /api/push/feed`, `POST /api/push/subscribe|unsubscribe|test`.
- Test: `curl -XPOST -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}' https://<host>:<port>/api/push/test`
- ntfy is now optional; with `NTFY_TOPIC` set, every alert is also sent there (same debounce).
- Code: `push.js` (VAPID, subscriptions, feed, `createAlerts().alert()` fan-out), `public/sw.js`, bell in `public/app.js`.

## AI manager

`stall.js` classifies why an agent stopped — `continue`, `menu_recommended`, `permission`,
`owner_decision`, `done`, `error`, plus `stopped_short`, `waiting_deploy`, `owner_action` (below) — with rules first and Jev (closed choice
`continue | take_recommended | ask_owner`) for the ambiguous ones. `manager.js` logs every stall
to `stalls.jsonl` with what it would answer, then the owner's real reply as its outcome.

**Stops that bother the owner** (finished turns, rules only):

| case | what it is | would answer / escalation |
|---|---|---|
| `stopped_short` | the agent says what it will do next ("I'll start adding X", "Next I'll ...", "Once it is built I'll rerun ...") and stops, no question, no blocker (a wait, "I'm stopping here", "say the word", a running background job all rule it out) | "Yes, continue." (auto case, off by default) |
| `waiting_deploy` | waiting for leases, live runs or a go-ahead to deploy / restart | never answered; escalated "deploy waiting — queue it (Phase 7)"; the log record carries `deployHint: {scope?, ref?}` (`--host` / `--server` / `--frontend`, `update_core <ref>`, `main`) |
| `owner_action` | the agent asks the owner for a small manual thing (reload a page, plug a device, press a button, check the phone) | never answered; escalated "needs you: <short action>" |

Any finished-turn stall also carries `no_status`: the closing text (the agent's own words, not tool
output) never says what is done / tested / left / next / blocked. It is a flag, not a case, and is not set
for questions, deploy waits or owner actions. A `done` stall with `no_status` has the would-answer
"Before stopping: what is done, what is tested, what is left?" (auto case `ask_status`, off by default).

**One stop, one record.** A TUI that merely repaints makes ghosty show `working` for a few seconds; that
is not progress. A session only counts as having moved on when real work was seen (the spinner signal
ghosty already computes, passed to `observe` as `realWork`) or ghosty sent it something. An outcome is only
logged after that, and a stall identical to the last logged one is not logged again unless one of those
happened in between.

The last 5 logged stops (hashes of their whitespace-free closing text) are kept per session in `<state dir>/last-stops.json`,
so a service restart or a repaint does not log it again either; real work, a send or a reporter prompt in between
resets that list, so the same words then count as a new stop. An `outcome` only uses a reply that came after the stop: the reporter's prompt must
be newer than the stall, and from the pane only a `❯ prompt` line below the stall's closing text counts (an older prompt
above it, or a closing text no longer on screen, gives kind `unknown`).

**Safe defaults.** `autoSend` off, `autoCases: []`, `aiTriage: 'simulate'`, `aiAutoCases: []`: the owner picks
every case that may be auto-answered (`POST /api/manager`). `owner_decision` is never in a default list.

**Who acted (`by`).** `POST /api/send/:session`, `/api/send-many`, `/api/manager/label`, `/api/session-meta/:session`
and `/api/deploys/:id/approve|cancel` take an optional `by` (string, 1..40 characters; default `owner`, which is what
the UI means). The Opus manager agent passes `by: "manager-agent"`. It is logged in `stalls.jsonl` (`{type:'send'|
'pause'|'resume'|'priority'|'deploy_action', by}`, and `by` on `label` records) and shown on the lines of the manager
panel log.

**Alert API.** `POST /api/alert {title, body, url?, priority?, tag?}` is the manager agent's channel to the owner.
Loopback peers only, with the reporter token header (`x-ghosty-reporter-token`); anything else is 403 / 401. It goes
through the normal `alert()` (same debounce per `tag` or title, notification feed, Web Push, ntfy): the answer is
`{ok:true, sent:true}` or `{ok:true, sent:false, debounced:true}`. `title` 1..120, `body` 1..1000, `url` starts with
`/` or `http(s)://`, `priority` one of `min|low|default|high|urgent`. At most 10 calls per hour (429 beyond).

**Owner labels.** In the manager panel every stop has 👎 (stopped for no reason) / 👍 (legit) buttons,
a "wrong case" picker and an optional note; "unlabelled stops only" filters the list and a row's session
name opens its card. `POST /api/manager/label {id, label: no_reason|legit|wrong_case, note?, correctCase?}`
appends `{type:'label', ...}` to `stalls.jsonl`. `npm run stall-report` prints labels per case and the
`no_reason` examples; `--export <file>` writes the labelled stops as JSON (pick a path outside the repo: the
excerpts are real text) for future fixtures; `--reclassify` re-runs the current classifier over the logged
excerpts and prints how cases change (the log is not modified).

**Answer buttons + AI reviewer (TASK-44 phase 9).** The row under a card header that asks for you shows buttons derived from
the question (`public/buttons.js`): a live numbered menu (permission prompt, AskUserQuestion) gets one button per option with
its label that sends its key (esc small); a yes/no question gets **Yes** / **No** (typed as text); an either/or or open question
gets the AI's proposed reply as the primary button, Claude's own dim suggestion if any, and "✎ reply…" (focuses the dock on that
session). The raw keys stay behind "keys ▾". A reply on a forbidden topic (deploy, push, delete, secrets, money, customer) needs
a second tap ("tap again: sensitive topic"). For every stop that goes to you (not plain `done`, not `background_wait`, not what
auto-answer handles) the **AI reviewer** reads it after the rules and Jev: one `POST <JEV_URL host>/server/ai/complete` (usage
`text.plan`, same `X-API-Key`) returns `{proposed_reply, reasoning, confidence, owner_needed, owner_needed_why}`; one call per
stop, 25 s timeout, daily budget `aiDailyUsd` (1.00) and `aiDailyCalls` (300) in `ai-budget.json`. It is logged as a follow-up
`{type:'triage', id, ai, cost, ms}` record and shown on the card ("Jev: … · AI: “…” — reasoning (confidence)" with Send AI reply /
Edit / Dismiss), in the NEEDS YOU banner and in the push body. `manager.json` `aiTriage`: `off` | `simulate` (default: compute,
show, log, never type) | `auto` (owner-only switch: an AI proposal with `owner_needed:false`, confidence ≥ `aiMinConfidence`
(0.85), no forbidden topic in the question or the reply, no draft, case in `aiAutoCases`, goes through the normal countdown /
hourly cap / fire-time checks, and needs `autoSend` too). `AI_URL` overrides the derived reviewer URL. In the swipe review the
card shows the AI proposal; ✓ right / ✗ wrong posts `{type:'label', id, aiVerdict}` (does not label the stop itself);
`npm run stall-report` prints the AI agreement; the manager panel shows the switch, today's calls / cost and the agreement.
The server returns token counts, not a cost, so the logged cost is an estimate (`AI_USD_PER_MTOK_IN/OUT`, default 3 / 15).

**Swipe review (the main way to label).** `/?review=1`, the topbar button (cards icon) or "Review stops (N)" in the
manager panel opens a full-screen deck of unlabelled stops, newest first, one card at a time: session (tap = open its
card) · agent · age, the case the manager chose, what it would have answered, Jev's pick, `no_status`, and the full closing
text (the end is scrolled into view), plus your own reply if one was logged. **Swipe right = good** (a legit stop, label
`legit`), **left = bad** (stopped for no reason, `no_reason`), **up = skip** (no label, back of the deck). The card follows the
finger, tilts, shows a BAD / GOOD stamp past the threshold and snaps back under it. Buttons (✕ ↷ ✓) and the keys ← ↑ → do the
same; **Undo** (button, Backspace, `u`, Ctrl+Z) withdraws the last swipe. **Long-press** a card for a note and "manager got the
case wrong" (the correct case); they ride on the next swipe, which still decides good/bad. The panel's 👎/👍 remain but are
dimmed.

- `GET /api/manager/review?limit=50` -> `{cards, unlabelled, labelledToday, cases}`: unlabelled `stall` records (no effective
  label), newest first, each with id, at, session, project, agent, state, case, source, why, wouldSend, deployHint, no_status,
  jev {choice, confidence}, excerpt and `outcome` {reply, kind, via, afterSec} when the owner's reply was logged.
- `POST /api/manager/unlabel {id}` appends `{type:'unlabel', id}`. Readers (`effectiveLabels` in `manager.js`, the panel,
  `stall-report`) treat it as: the newest `label` of an id wins, an `unlabel` after it removes it. A `label` record may carry
  `correctCase` next to `no_reason`/`legit`; the report counts it under `wrong_case` as well.
- Code: `public/review.js` (loaded on demand), styles `.rv-*` in `style.css`.

**Sending is off by default.** Turn it on (`autoSend`) and only the cases in `autoCases` are typed
(`continue` and `stopped_short` -> "Yes, continue."; `ask_status` -> the status question; `menu_recommended` -> the option's number in a live menu, or "Yes,
go with your recommendation." after a finished turn). A forbidden topic (deploy, push/merge to
main, delete/remove, migration, `.env`, credentials, money, customer) or an unsent draft in the
input box always means "ask the owner", whatever Jev says. The manager never starts, kills or
renames sessions.

An answer is not typed at once: it is shown on the card / board row as a pill
**"auto: Yes, continue. in 23s ✕"** (✕ or `POST /api/manager/cancel/:session` cancels). When the
delay is up everything is checked again against the live pane (same stall, session still waiting or
done, no draft typed, still not forbidden, session still enabled, under the cap) and only then
typed, through the same send code as the dock. Every answer, cancellation and escalation is logged.
Anything not auto-answered (owner case, forbidden, draft, low Jev confidence, cap reached, auto
off) goes to the owner via ntfy with a deep link and the reason ("deploy question — needs you");
a waiting session is covered by the existing "needs you" push.

`manager.json` (in `GHOSTY_STATE_DIR`; also `GET/POST /api/manager`):

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | watch and log stalls at all |
| `autoSend` | `false` | global switch for typing answers |
| `autoCases` | `[]` | cases allowed to auto-send; valid: `continue`, `menu_recommended`, `stopped_short`, `ask_status` |
| `minConfidence` | `0.8` | Jev-derived answers need this probability for the chosen option (rule answers count 1.0) |
| `delayMs` | `30000` | countdown before an answer is typed |
| `maxPerSessionPerHour` | `4` | auto answers per session per rolling hour |
| `disabledSessions` | `[]` | sessions the manager ignores (tick them off in the panel) |
| `policyEnabled` | `true` | quota policy by priority (below) |
| `p1MaxPct` / `p2MaxPct` | `80` / `80` | 5 h fill at which P1 / P2 sessions are held |

The robot icon in the top bar opens the manager panel: global auto-answer switch, per-case
checkboxes, per-session on/off, today's answered / cancelled / escalated counts and the last 30
log entries.

**Policy by priority and quota** (`public/policy.js`, pure and unit-tested). At a stall the manager
would auto-answer (all safety gates above already passed), the policy decides `allow` or `hold`:

- **P0**: always allowed. The safety gates (forbidden topic, draft, confidence, cap) still apply.
- **P1**: allowed while its agent's 5 h window is under `p1MaxPct`.
- **P2**: held when the 5 h window is at or over `p2MaxPct`, or when the weekly window is projected to run out
  before its reset (used % / elapsed fraction of the week > 100 %, only once 10 % of the week has elapsed).
- Unknown quota (stale, expired window, no data, `usedPercent` null) is allowed with reason "quota unknown".
- Plans: claude -> Claude Max, codex -> Codex, minimax -> MiniMax.

A hold is stored in `sessions.json` as `held:{by:'manager',reason,at}`, separate from the owner's `paused`,
logged `{type:'hold', by:'manager'}` and pushed once ("task05 held: Claude Max 5h 86% (P2)"). It never sends
Esc and never interrupts a working session; it only stops the session from being continued at its stop. Every
quota poll (60 s) re-evaluates held sessions: when the policy allows again the hold is cleared, `{type:'resume',
by:'manager'}` is logged and pushed, and a session still stopped at the same stall is scheduled normally (usual
countdown and cancel). The owner's Resume (play button, also shown on a held card) clears a hold too and
sends `continue`. A held session that moves on by itself loses the hold. Cards, rows and the sidebar show
"held: quota" (tooltip = reason); the manager panel lists held sessions. The manager never switches an agent.

**New session.** The dialog has a priority picker (default P2, sent as `priority` to `POST /api/sessions`) and
preselects the agent with the most headroom, shown as "suggested: ...": P2 prefers MiniMax unless it is known
to be under pressure; P0 prefers Claude unless Claude is at 95 % or more; P1 takes the most headroom among
known plans (Claude on ties). It is a suggestion only: picking an agent yourself wins.

```bash
npm run stall-report -- --days 3 --list      # precision per case vs. what the owner answered, owner labels
npm run stall-report -- --days 3 --reclassify --export ~/labelled-stops.json
curl -s localhost:7777/api/manager            # config + Jev budget + today's counts
curl -s -XPOST localhost:7777/api/manager -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"autoSend":true,"autoCases":["continue"],"delayMs":30000}'
curl -s -XPOST localhost:7777/api/manager/cancel/task05 -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

## Session reporter (TASK-44 phase 8)

`claude-plugin/ghosty-reporter/` is a Claude Code plugin (function hooks, Claude Code >= 2.1.288) that every
Claude session on the box loads. It is a **pure observer**: every hook awaits `next(e)` and returns its result
untouched, reports after that with an 800 ms bound, swallows every error and prints nothing. If ghosty is
down the session behaves as without the plugin (one failed try, then 30 s of silence).

**Install for all sessions** (owner action, one line in `~/.claude/settings.json`; the plugin is not part of the
settings otherwise):

```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS": "/home/jndoye/ghosty-sessions/claude-plugin/ghosty-reporter" } }
```

New sessions pick it up; running ones keep going without it. One session only: `claude --plugin-dir <folder>`.

| plugin env / option | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GHOSTY_REPORTER_URL` (or plugin option `url`) | `http://127.0.0.1:7777/api/reporter/event` | where events go |
| `GHOSTY_STATE_DIR` | `~/.local/state/ghosty` | where `reporter.token` is read from |
| `GHOSTY_REPORTER_TOKEN_FILE` | `<state dir>/reporter.token` | token file override |

ghosty creates `reporter.token` (0600) in its state dir at startup if missing. `POST /api/reporter/event` accepts
loopback peers only, with the token in the `x-ghosty-reporter-token` header; anything else is 403 / 401.
`POST /api/alert` uses the same check and token (see "Alert API" under the manager).

The session is identified by its tmux session name (`tmux display-message -p -t $TMUX_PANE '#S'`, once, at the first
event) plus the Claude session id and cwd; a session outside tmux is ignored.

| event (plugin hook) | payload | what ghosty does |
|---|---|---|
| `session.start` / `session.end` (`session.start`, `session.end`) | reason | session is `live` / not |
| `prompt` (`prompt.submit`) | the submitted text (exact, 8 KB cap), `synthetic` for engine-raised prompts such as a finished background task | the owner's reply in the stall `outcome` (`via: "reporter"`); a prompt after a stall also counts as the session moving on |
| `turn.end` (`turn.complete`) | the final answer (exact), reason, usage; subagent turns carry `agentId` and are ignored as the session's turn | closing text of the stall classifier |
| `stop` (`classic.Stop`) | `last_assistant_message`, `backgroundWork` = background tasks in flight | `background_wait` when > 0 |
| `waiting` (`classic.PermissionRequest`, `classic.Notification` except idle / auth) | message | marks the session `waiting` even when the pane regex missed it, while the pane stays still |
| `agents` (`agent.spawn`, `classic.SubagentStart/Stop`, `classic.TeammateIdle`, after `turn.complete`) | `$.agent.list()`: id, type, status, description, sent only when it changed | subagent count + statuses in the ⚡ tooltip |

What the manager does with it (Claude sessions only; Codex / MiniMax unchanged): a stop whose turn has a fresh report
(no newer prompt, ended within 20 s of the stop being seen) is classified from the **reported answer text** instead
of the pane excerpt (`textSource: "reporter"`, else `"pane"`, in `stalls.jsonl`; `source` stays the rule / Jev
decision source). A reported turn with background work in flight is logged as `case: "background_wait"` and is never
escalated or answered. The pane is still read for the owner's unsent draft and for waiting menus / permission dialogs.

The status payload carries a small `reporter` object per live Claude session (`seenAt`, `turnAt`, `backgroundWork`,
`waiting`, `agents {count, by}`, `agentList`); the cards show a ⚡ (with the subagent count) whose tooltip lists them.
`GET /api/reporter/:session` returns everything held for one session (latest turn, prompt, waiting, agents).

Develop / test the plugin: `claude plugin validate claude-plugin/ghosty-reporter` and
`claude plugin test claude-plugin/ghosty-reporter` (tests in `ghosty-reporter.test.ts`); ghosty side: `npm test`.

## Deploy queue (TASK-44 phase 7)

Agents do not run `update_core.sh`; they queue a request in the shared lease registry (`vpt-lease deploy request ...`)
and wait (`vpt-lease deploy wait <id> --agent A`). `deploy-runner.js` polls the queue every 30 s and shows it on the
**Platforms page** (approve / cancel, what each request waits on, live log of the running one, a warning when the ref
differs from the last one deployed). A request without `--approved` waits for one tap there and pushes an alert.
The manager sheet keeps only the "Runs deploys" switch and a link to Platforms.

- **Off by default.** The runner only starts deploys when `manager.json` has `"deployRunner": true` (switch in the
  manager sheet or `POST /api/manager {"deployRunner":true}`). Off = it only reads the queue.
- **Env map** (not in the repo): `$GHOSTY_STATE_DIR/deploy-envs.json`, written with defaults on first run:
  `{ "<env>": { "ssh": "<host>", "cmd": "bash update_core.sh", "health": "<optional remote command, exit 0 = healthy>" } }`.
  Only envs in the map are deployed. Scope to flags: `frontend` -> `--frontend`, `host` -> `--host`, `server` -> `--server`,
  `full` -> none. The command runs as `ssh <host> "VPT_LEASE_AGENT=manager:deploy <cmd> <ref> <flags>"` (45 min timeout), output in
  `$GHOSTY_STATE_DIR/deploys/<id>.log`. Without `health`, only update_core's exit code decides done / failed.
- One running deploy per env. Queued requests with the same env + ref that the running scope covers (`full` covers all; other scopes only
  themselves) are finished with its result (`coalescedInto`).
- Registry: `ssh proxmox '~/bin/vpt-lease ...'`; `DEPLOY_REGISTRY='["python3","/path/vpt-lease"]'` runs it locally (tests, live checks).
  `DEPLOY_POLL_MS`, `DEPLOY_TIMEOUT_MS` override the timings.
- API: `GET /api/deploys`, `POST /api/deploys/:id/approve|cancel`, `GET /api/deploys/:id/log?tail=200`; `{type:'deploys'}` on `/ws/status`.

## Platforms page, lease ownership, waiting for a deploy (TASK-44)

Open it from the ⋮ menu -> Platforms, from a lease chip / purple badge, or `/?platforms=1` (`/?deploys=1`, the push link, opens it too).
Per env: a table `resource · held by · left · purpose`, the **Deploy queue**, and a one-line **Deployed now** summary
(tap to expand per target, from the registry's ledger).

- **Exact ownership.** A lease belongs to a session iff its agent is `<machine>:<tmux session name>`, case-insensitive;
  `<machine>` is `codebox` or this host's name. Agents get it with `AGENT="codebox:$(tmux display-message -p '#S')"` (deploy skill).
  There is no fuzzy guess: any other agent id shows as `unknown: <agent>`. Code: `public/platforms.js` (pure, shared with the server),
  `leases.js` (reads `vpt-lease list --json`, 15 s cache, injectable `run`).
- **Status payload.** `status[session].lease` = `[{env, resource, ttlLeftMin, purpose, blocksDeploy}]` (`blocksDeploy`: an
  awaiting-approval or queued deploy of that env whose scope touches the resource). `/api/leases` and the `leases` WS message also carry `waiters` and `hostname`.
- **Lease chip.** Only a session holding a lease gets `🔒 pi1/stb4 · 1h40` (`+N` for more) in the card header and board row; amber
  `· blocks deploy` while a pending deploy waits on it. Tap -> Platforms scrolled to that resource.
- **Purple "waiting deploy"** (`status[session].deployWait`, state badge, card border, row, tab, NEEDS-YOU order right after red): the session
  (1) is the requester of an awaiting-approval / queued / running deploy, (2) is a registered waiter (`vpt-lease deploy wait --agent`; the
  registry keeps `waiters.json`, heartbeat on every poll, dropped after 10 min without one), or (3) its latest stop was classified
  `waiting_deploy` (cleared when it works again). A live needs-you prompt always wins visually. The tooltip says which one applies;
  tap -> Platforms at that deploy.

## Priority, pause and quota

**Priority.** Every session is `P0`, `P1` or `P2` (default `P2`, also for a session seen for the first
time or created with `POST /api/sessions`). The badge on the card header, board row and sidebar is a
button: tap it to pick. P0 sorts first on the board, in the needs-you banner and in the card order, then
the usual order. `POST /api/session-meta/:session {"priority":"P0"}`. Stored in
`$GHOSTY_STATE_DIR/sessions.json` keyed by tmux session name; an entry is dropped after the session has
been gone for more than 7 days. The status payload carries `priority` and `paused`.

**Pause / resume (owner).** The pause button (pause glyph, card header and board row) calls
`POST /api/session-meta/:session {"paused":true}`: Escape is sent once, then the hold is kept (persisted).
While held the manager never auto-answers or continues that session, cancels a pending auto answer, and
does not ping you about it. `{"paused":false}` clears the hold and types `continue` + Enter. Both are
logged to `stalls.jsonl` as `{type:'pause'|'resume', session, by:'owner'}`. Ghosty never kills, renames or
starts sessions on its own.

**Quota.** `quota.js` runs every 60 s, Codex and MiniMax are really asked only every 5 minutes (cached in between) (`GET /api/quota`, also pushed on `/ws/status` as `{type:'quota'}`);
the row under the health strip reads `codex 5h 0% wk 32% . claude ? . minimax 5h 2% wk ∞`, amber from 80 %, red
from 95 %, tap for reset times. One push alert when a window crosses 80 %, re-armed below 70 % (the first
reading after a restart only seeds, it does not alert).

| plan | source | notes |
|---|---|---|
| Codex (Plus, 20 EUR/month) | live account read: `codex app-server` over stdio JSON-RPC (`initialize`, `initialized`, `account/rateLimits/read`), killed after the answer, 20 s timeout, no model call | 5h = `primary` (300 min), week = `secondary` (10080 min); a window whose reset time has passed reads 0 % (`expired`) |
| Claude Max (200 EUR/month) | `$GHOSTY_STATE_DIR/claude-rate-limits.json` written by `scripts/claude-statusline-ratelimits.sh` | no limit file exists on disk; Claude Code passes `rate_limits` (`five_hour`, `seven_day`: `used_percentage`, `resets_at`, Pro/Max logins, after the first reply) to its status-line command. Shows `?` until the script is installed as the status line |
| MiniMax (Token Plan) | the calls mcode's `/usage` makes: `GET platform.minimax.io/v1/api/openplatform/coding_plan/remains` with mcode's stored login as bearer token (read per request, in memory, never logged or kept) (plan name/expiry are not read: that needs mcode's signed client calls, deliberately not replicated) | 5h used % = 100 - remaining %; week is `unlimited:true` (no %, never triggers the weekly-projection hold) or a %. The login is never refreshed: when mcode's access token has expired the plan shows the last value as stale with `mcode login expired — open mcode once` |

A failed read keeps the last good value with `stale:true` and an `error` (the quota sheet shows it); a stale plan
never holds a session. The quota sheet shows each plan's subscription and "unlimited" weekly windows.

Env: `CODEX_BIN` (default `~/.local/bin/codex`), `MINIMAX_AUTH_FILE` (mcode login file, default the `en`/prod one),
`CLAUDE_RATE_LIMITS_FILE` override the paths.

Claude status line: in `~/.claude/settings.json` set
`"statusLine": {"type": "command", "command": "/home/<user>/ghosty-sessions/scripts/claude-statusline-ratelimits.sh"}`
(needs `jq`). It reads only the JSON on stdin and prints `model 5h NN% wk NN%`.

## Usage (Langfuse)

A local Langfuse (v3) on the host plus a tailer, `usage/ingest.js`, give token usage and cost per
session, project, agent, model and day. The tailer sends usage numbers and ids only, never prompt or
reply text.

- **Langfuse**: Docker compose in `~/langfuse-codebox/` (outside any repo; web, worker, Postgres,
  ClickHouse, Redis, MinIO, named volumes, `restart: unless-stopped`). Only the web UI is published,
  on `127.0.0.1:3100` and the tailnet IP `:3100` (open `http://<tailnet-ip>:3100`). Login, project
  `codebox-usage` and its API keys come from the headless-init variables in
  `~/langfuse-codebox/.env` (chmod 600). Telemetry and signup are off.
- **Tailer**: unit `systemd/ghosty-usage.service` (`sudo ln -sf $PWD/systemd/ghosty-usage.service /etc/systemd/system/`,
  `daemon-reload`, `enable --now`). It reads the API keys from `~/.config/ghosty/usage.env`
  (`LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, optional `LANGFUSE_URL`), chmod 600.
- **Sources**: Claude Code transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, including `subagents/`), Codex
  rollouts (`~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`, one generation per `token_usage_record`), and MiniMax
  (`local_runtime_token_usage` in `~/.minimax/v2/sqlite/runtime-state.sqlite`, read-only; the table has no
  model column, so `MINIMAX_DEFAULT_MODEL` is assumed and cost stays unknown).
- **Per message**: one trace per agent session, one generation per assistant turn (deterministic ids, so replays
  upsert). A Claude message is logged as several lines with the same `message.id` and a growing
  `output_tokens`; the largest wins. `usage/prices.json` holds USD per million tokens per model-id prefix
  with `source` and `as_of`; a model without a price gets no cost (never guessed).
- **State**: `~/.local/state/ghosty/usage-offsets.json` (byte offsets), `usage-ledger.jsonl` (one compact
  record per turn), `usage-summary.json` (rewritten every minute: totals per session / project / agent / model /
  day for the last 14 days, plus `outliers` = sessions whose cost per active hour today is over 3x their
  project's median; rule in `buildSummary()`), a `today` block (totals / agent / project / model for the UTC day)
  and per session `today`, `days`, `activeHours` for the usage view.
- **Rerun the backfill**: `node usage/ingest.js --backfill` (forgets offsets, re-reads the last `BACKFILL_DAYS`
  days; Langfuse upserts by id, no duplicates). `--once` does a single pass.

| var | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `LANGFUSE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3100` | Langfuse base URL |
| `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` / `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` | unset (required) | project API keys |
| `BACKFILL_DAYS` | `14` | first-run / `--backfill` window and summary window |
| `USAGE_PACE_MS` | `1500` | pause between ingestion requests (100 events each) |
| `USAGE_POLL_MS` / `USAGE_SUMMARY_MS` | `15000` / `60000` | tail cadence / summary cadence |
| `CLAUDE_PROJECTS_DIR` / `CODEX_SESSIONS_DIR` / `MINIMAX_DB` | under `$HOME` | source locations |
| `MINIMAX_DEFAULT_MODEL` | `MiniMax-M3` | model name assumed for MiniMax rows |
| `USAGE_PRICES` | `usage/prices.json` | price table |

The `session:` tag is the tmux session name (matched from the pane's current path to the transcript's
`cwd`, only for traces active in the last 10 minutes), else the cwd's folder name.

### Usage view (UI)

The bar-chart icon in the topbar (next to the robot) opens **Usage - API-equivalent**: tabs **Today** (UTC day)
and **14 days**, with totals, per agent, per project (top 10), per session (top 15, outliers first; project,
agent, model, cost, tokens, cost per active hour), per day (CSS bars, 14 days tab) and per model, tokens as
in / out / cache r / cache w (`12.3M`). A session row opens that session's card; the footer links to Langfuse
(`http://100.74.90.82:3100`, tailnet).

- **All costs are API-equivalent at list prices, not money spent.** The plans are flat subscriptions (Claude Max
  200 EUR, Codex / ChatGPT Plus 20 EUR, MiniMax 40 EUR per month); each agent row shows its plan and the live 5 h /
  week quota % from `/api/quota`. MiniMax has no price: cost shows `—` and tokens are shown, never `$0`
  (`costOrNull()`: cost 0 with unpriced turns = null).
- **Chip** on every card header, board row and sidebar entry: `$3.20 today` (or `12M tok today` when unpriced).
  An outlier is red with a warning sign; tap = toast with the reason (`9.9x the <project> median: $4.01/h vs
  $1.2/h`), tap on a normal chip opens the sheet.
- **`GET /api/usage`**: the summary plus `sessions` = `{ <live tmux name>: { todayCost, todayTokens, totalCost,
  outlier, days:[14 x {day, cost, total}] } }`; 404 when the file is absent. The file is cached 30 s
  (`usage-view.js`); the per-tick status payload gets `usage: {todayCost, todayTokens, totalCost, outlier} | null`
  per session from that cache (a Map lookup, no file reads). A session is matched by the summary's `session`
  label (the tmux name, see above); several traces with one label add up.
- `USAGE_SUMMARY` overrides the summary path (default `$GHOSTY_STATE_DIR/usage-summary.json`).
- A summary written on an earlier UTC day (dead tailer) reports no today usage and no outliers. The Today tab and
  per-session `today` / `days` need the tailer that writes the `today` block: after updating, restart `ghosty-usage`.
- Helpers (pure, unit-tested): `public/usage.js`; server side `usage-view.js`; tests `test/usageview.test.js`.

## Architecture

```
┌────────────┐  capture-pane  ┌─────────────────┐  WebSocket :7777  ┌────────┐
│  tmux      │ ─────────────▶ │ ghosty-server   │ ─────────────────▶ │ phone  │
│  (11 sess) │  tmux send-keys│ (Node 20+, ws)  │  JSON snapshot    │ (PWA)  │
└────────────┘ ◀───────────── └─────────────────┘                   └────────┘
                              also: /api/sessions, /api/send/:s
```

- `server.js` keeps an in-memory cache of the last pane for every session.
- WebSocket clients (`/ws/:session`) get the latest snapshot each tick.
- `/ws/status` broadcasts status pills to everyone (drives the UI colours).
- `POST /api/send/:session` runs `tmux send-keys -l "..."` then `Enter`.

## Status pill heuristic

| state | meaning |
|---|---|
| `wait` | pane contains a permission prompt (`[Y/n]`, `(y/N)`, `Allow?`, etc.) |
| `busy` | activity in last 5 s **and** pane contains a generation glyph (`⠿`, `Thinking`, …) |
| `busy` | activity in last 2 s (anything typing) |
| `idle` | otherwise |
| `offline` | session is not in `tmux list-sessions` |

Tune `classify()` in `server.js` if you want stricter or looser behaviour.

## Adding xterm sessions automatically

Every tmux session on `codebox` shows up in Ghosty. To start a new Claude session:

```bash
ssh codebox
tmux new-session -d -s my-new-task -c ~/virtualpytest \
  '$HOME/.local/bin/claude --dangerously-skip-permissions; bash -l'
```

It appears in the sidebar within ~1 s.

## Security

- Tailscale ACL is the only gate.
- No auth prompt in the UI by design — anyone on your tailnet is "you".
- `tmux send-keys` runs as `jndoye`, scoped to the session name in the URL.
  Validate inputs server-side if you ever expose this beyond your tailnet.
