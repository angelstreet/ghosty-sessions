# Ghosty Sessions — handover

Where this lives: **`~/ghosty-sessions/` on `codebox` (VM 190, Tailscale `100.74.90.82`)**.
Git remote: `git@github.com:angelstreet/ghosty-sessions` (public).

This file is the **first** thing to read when resuming work. Everything else
(architecture, runbook, certs, status pill heuristic) is in `README.md` and
`certs/README.md`.

## 30-second bring-up

```bash
ssh codebox
sudo systemctl status ghosty-sessions --no-pager    # should be active
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:7777/api/health           # {"ok":true,...}
curl -ksS https://127.0.0.1:7443/api/health         # same, over TLS

# if it's down:
sudo systemctl restart ghosty-sessions
journalctl -u ghosty-sessions -n 50 --no-pager      # recent logs
```

Service runs as `jndoye` with `WorkingDirectory=/home/jndoye/ghosty-sessions`,
binds `0.0.0.0:7777` (HTTP) and `0.0.0.0:7443` (HTTPS, self-signed).

## Access URLs

| URL | Use |
|---|---|
| `http://100.74.90.82:7777/` | daily driver on the tailnet — works, no install ceremony |
| `https://100.74.90.82:7443/` | for installing the PWA (Android Chrome refuses SW on plain HTTP); accept the cert once |
| `https://codebox.taile677a6.ts.net:7443/` | if you ever want the ts.net name instead of the IP |

## Resume the dev session

There is a persistent tmux session `ghosty` on codebox that drops you straight
into this repo:

```bash
# from the Mac:
~/bin/codebox-ghosty

# from any box with the key:
ssh codebox 'tmux new-session -A -s ghosty -c ~/ghosty-sessions'
```

The session starts with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions; bash -l` so when
Claude exits you land in a shell at the repo root, not kicked out of the session.

## What's done (v2 — cockpit)

**States** — working (pulsing green + current step), needs you (red, prompt + 1/2/3/esc), done
(blue, agent finished its turn), idle (grey), offline. Agent badge (claude/codex/minimax/bash via
process tree), repo/branch*, context left, model, linked lease.

**Phone (≤720px)** — board is home (sorted needs you > done > working > idle); tap row = card,
long-press = set send target. Card: swipe header/reader left/right = next/prev session, "Aa / >_"
toggles reader (last reply as readable text) vs raw terminal. Tabs + grid hidden.

**Desktop** — grid 2/4/6/9/all; tap = send target ("→ send target" pill), double-tap = open card.
Reorder: drag a card by its header (desktop), or ◀ ▲ ▼ ▶ on the selected card (touch); order saved per device.

**Dock** — fixed-width target chip (tap = picker), quick-prompt chips (long-press edit, + adds),
history, quick keys, sent ✓ / delivered ✓✓, multi-target send.

**Sidebar** — grouped by state, rename, kill (type name to confirm), "+" new session (agent + dir
from `/api/dirs` + name), collapsible leases.

**Alerts** — bell = in-page notification; set `NTFY_TOPIC` (see README) for real push to the phone.

**Security** — cross-origin POST/WS rejected (Origin ≠ Host), JSON-only POSTs, 64KB body cap,
exact tmux targets (`=name:`), create limited to dirs under $HOME, execFile only.

## Known issues / not done

| # | Issue | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Codex prompt/done/activity patterns untested (no live Codex pane) | calibrate `WAIT_RE` / done markers on a real codex session |
| 2 | "waiting" can false-positive on prompt-like text in the last ~15 lines | e.g. a quoted "Do you want to proceed?" |
| 3 | `ntfy` not configured yet | add `Environment=NTFY_TOPIC=<secret-topic>` + `PUBLIC_URL` to the systemd unit |
| 4 | Board reorders when states change | by design (urgency sort); rows are moved in place, not rebuilt |
| 5 | Dock is 3 rows tall on phones | consider collapsing quick keys until the input is focused |
| 6 | No HTTPS via `tailscale serve` (free plan) | self-signed on :7443 works after manual accept |
| 7 | SW cache v5 | bump again if stale JS ever shows |

## Commit conventions

- One feature per commit, message starts with `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `refactor:`
- Push directly to `main` (no PR flow yet — single-author)
- Always: `git diff --cached` before commit, then `git add` + `git commit` + `git push` in one Bash call to keep other agents from stepping in mid-flight

## Repo links

- GitHub: <https://github.com/angelstreet/ghosty-sessions>
- Tailscale IP: `100.74.90.82`
- Tailnet: `taile677a6.ts.net`

## How to test the PWA install flow on a fresh phone

1. Join the `angelstreet` Tailscale tailnet on the phone (if not already).
2. Visit `https://100.74.90.82:7443/` in Chrome.
3. Tap **Advanced → Proceed to 100.74.90.82 (unsafe)**. Accept once.
4. The page loads → orange ↓ install icon in the topbar → tap → "Add to Home Screen" → done.
5. Launch from home screen — opens full-screen, no address bar, install button auto-hides.

## When you're done for the day

The session is named `ghosty` so you can re-attach from any box with the key:

```bash
ssh codebox 'tmux attach -t ghosty'
```

Or from the Mac:

```bash
~/bin/codebox-ghosty
```
