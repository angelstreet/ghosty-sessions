# Ghosty Sessions — handover

Where this lives: **`~/ghosty-sessions/` on `codebox` (VM 190, Tailscale `100.74.90.82`)**.
Git remote: `git@github.com:angelstreet/ghosty-sessions` (public).

This file is the **first** thing to read when resuming work. Everything else
(architecture, runbook, certs, status pill heuristic) is in `README.md` and
`certs/README.md`.

## 30-second bring-up

```bash
ssh codebox
sudo systemctl status ghosty-sessions --no-pager    # should be active
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:7777/api/health           # {"ok":true,...}
curl -ksS https://127.0.0.1:7443/api/health         # same, over TLS

# if it's down:
sudo systemctl restart ghosty-sessions
journalctl -u ghosty-sessions -n 50 --no-pager      # recent logs
```

Service runs as `jndoye` with `WorkingDirectory=/home/jndoye/ghosty-sessions`,
binds `0.0.0.0:7777` (HTTP) and `0.0.0.0:7443` (HTTPS, self-signed).

## AI manager (TASK-44) — the map

Full spec, permissions, status and the codebox system map: **TASK-44 in virtualpytest,
`docs/tasks/TASK-44-ai-manager.md`** (branch `task44-ai-manager` until merged). In one paragraph: ghosty watches every
agent session, logs every stop once with a reason, asks Jev (and an AI reviewer) what a safe reply would be, shows it
to the owner, and — only for what the owner switched on — answers, holds or deploys. Today: answering **off**, policy
on (inert), AI triage **simulate**, deploy runner **off**.

| Piece | Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stop log + reasons | `stall.js`, `manager.js` | one record per stop (repaints and re-wrapped panes fold, `stopKey`); cases continue / menu_recommended / permission / owner_decision / done / error / stopped_short / waiting_deploy / owner_action / background_wait, `no_status` flag; Jev for ambiguous ones |
| Answering (off) | `manager.js` (schedule/fire), `public/buttons.js` | countdown pill + cancel, hourly cap, re-checked at fire time; forbidden topics / drafts never |
| AI triage (simulate) | `triage.js` | `POST /server/ai/complete` usage `text.plan`; proposal + reasoning + confidence + owner_needed; budget `ai-budget.json` |
| Labels / swipe review | `public/review.js`, `/api/manager/review`, `/label`, `/unlabel` | left = no reason, right = legit; ✓/✗ the AI; `npm run stall-report` |
| Priority / pause / holds | `session-meta.js`, `public/policy.js` | P0/P1/P2 (default P2); owner Pause = Esc + hold; manager holds never send Esc |
| Quota | `quota.js` | Claude via `scripts/claude-statusline-ratelimits.sh` (status line), Codex via `codex app-server`, MiniMax via `coding_plan/remains` with mcode's login |
| Usage | `usage/ingest.js` (unit `ghosty-usage`), `usage-view.js` | local Langfuse `~/langfuse-codebox/` (`:3100`); API-equivalent costs |
| Session reporter | `claude-plugin/ghosty-reporter/`, `reporter.js` | see below |
| Deploys | `deploy-runner.js`, `public/deployed.js` | queue + ledger live in the `vpt-lease` registry on proxmox (deploy skill) |
| Alerts | `push.js` | Web Push (APK push parked), ntfy optional |
| Health | `health.js` | `/api/vm` |

State: `~/.local/state/ghosty/` (`manager.json` = switches, `stalls.jsonl`, `sessions.json`, budgets, `vapid.json`,
`push-subs.json`, `reporter.token`, `deploy-envs.json`, `usage-summary.json`, `claude-rate-limits.json`).
Working on it: one worktree per change, test on a spare port with a **fresh** `GHOSTY_STATE_DIR` (an old one may
have `autoSend` on), merge into main (merge, never rebase — other sessions commit here too), restart only after the
merge succeeded. Never `git add -A` (a TLS key nearly leaked once; `.certs-bak/` is ignored).

## Access URLs

| URL | Use |
|---|---|
| `http://100.74.90.82:7777/` | daily driver on the tailnet — works, no install ceremony |
| `https://100.74.90.82:7443/` | for installing the PWA (Android Chrome refuses SW on plain HTTP); accept the cert once |
| `https://codebox.taile677a6.ts.net:7443/` | if you ever want the ts.net name instead of the IP |

## Resume the dev session

There is a persistent tmux session `ghosty` on codebox that drops you straight
into this repo:

```bash
# from the Mac:
~/bin/codebox-ghosty

# from any box with the key:
ssh codebox 'tmux new-session -A -s ghosty -c ~/ghosty-sessions'
```

The session starts with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions; bash -l` so when
Claude exits you land in a shell at the repo root, not kicked out of the session.

## What's done (v2 — cockpit)

**States** — working (pulsing green + current step), needs you (red, prompt + 1/2/3/esc), done
(blue, agent finished its turn), idle (grey), offline. Agent badge (claude/codex/minimax/bash via
process tree), repo/branch*, context left, model, held leases (exact `codebox:<session>` match; see README "Platforms page"), purple "waiting deploy".

**Phone (≤720px)** — board is home (sorted needs you > done > working > idle); tap row = card,
long-press = set send target. Card: swipe header/reader left/right = next/prev session, "Aa / >_"
toggles reader (last reply as readable text) vs raw terminal. Tabs + grid hidden.

**Grid** — sizes 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 always visible at the far right of the top bar (tap = grid at that size, phones too); tap = send target ("→ send target" pill), double-tap = open card.
Reorder: drag a card by its header (desktop), or ◀ ▲ ▼ ▶ on the selected card (touch); order saved per device.

**Dock** — fixed-width target chip (tap = picker), quick-prompt chips (long-press edit, + adds),
history, quick keys, sent ✓ / delivered ✓✓, multi-target send.

**Sidebar** — grouped by state, rename, kill (type name to confirm), "+" new session (agent + dir
from `/api/dirs` + name), Platforms page in the ⋮ menu (leases, deploy queue, deployed now; replaces the sidebar leases list).

**Font & fit** — one global terminal font (A− / A+ / Aa popover, Ctrl+= / − / 0); detached sessions
are resized (`tmux resize-window`, then `window-size` unset so a later attach still resizes) to fill
their card — `POST /api/resize/:s`, 409 when a client is attached (then h-scroll), `GHOSTY_RESIZE_ALLOW`
regex limits which sessions may be resized. Toggle "Fit sessions to cards" in the Aa popover.

**Filters** — funnel button: status / project (GitHub repo from `origin`) / agent; applies to grid,
board, tabs, sidebar. Card headers show project · ⎇ branch(*) · ⑂ worktree in the middle.

**Dock** — chevron bottom-left collapses quick prompts + keys (remembered).

**Alerts** — bell = Web Push subscription (see README "Web Push"; state in the state dir: vapid.json, push-subs.json, push-feed.json). Optional extra phone push via ntfy: the secret `NTFY_TOPIC` + `PUBLIC_URL` are in
the gitignored `~/ghosty-sessions/.env` (loaded by the unit's `EnvironmentFile=`); pushes on "needs you" and on
disk critical (≥ 95 %, repeated every 6 h). `NTFY_DONE=1` adds turn-finished pushes.

**Health strip** (TASK-44 phase 1) — under the top bar: CPU %, load 1-min / cores, RAM used, disk used + free.
Amber ≥ 85 %, red ≥ 95 % (load: amber at 1x cores, red at 2x). `health.js` samples /proc + statfs every 5 s,
pushed as `{type:'health'}` on `/ws/status`, also `GET /api/vm`. Tests: `npm test`.

**Security** — cross-origin POST/WS rejected (Origin ≠ Host), JSON-only POSTs, 64KB body cap,
exact tmux targets (`=name:`), create limited to dirs under $HOME, execFile only.

## Known issues / not done

| # | Issue | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Codex prompt/done/activity patterns untested (no live Codex pane) | calibrate `WAIT_RE` / done markers on a real codex session |
| 2 | "waiting" can false-positive on prompt-like text in the last ~15 lines | e.g. a quoted "Do you want to proceed?" |
| 3 | `ntfy` not configured yet | add `Environment=NTFY_TOPIC=<secret-topic>` + `PUBLIC_URL` to the systemd unit |
| 4 | Board reorders when states change | by design (urgency sort); rows are moved in place, not rebuilt |
| 5 | Phone top bar is full at 360px — count chips get squeezed (they scroll) | hides less once installed (no install button) |
| 6 | No HTTPS via `tailscale serve` (free plan) | self-signed on :7443 works after manual accept |
| 7 | SW cache v6 | bump again if stale JS ever shows |

## Session reporter (TASK-44 phase 8)

`claude-plugin/ghosty-reporter/` reports structured Claude events to `POST /api/reporter/event` (loopback + token
from `<state dir>/reporter.token`); `reporter.js` keeps the latest per tmux session; `manager.js` prefers the
reported final answer over the pane excerpt, logs `background_wait`, and takes the owner's reply from the reported
prompt. Install = one `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_DIRS` line in `~/.claude/settings.json` (README, "Session reporter").
Things to know: `Stop` is the only hook that says whether background work is in flight, and it does not fire for
every turn end (an interrupted or declined-question turn has only `turn.complete`), so a missing count means 0;
a finished background task wakes the session with a synthetic `<task-notification>` prompt (marked, ignored as an
owner reply); the Notification hook for a permission dialog can arrive ~10 s after the dialog is drawn. The spinner
detector (`WORK_RE`) misses short turns on Claude 2.1.289, so a reported prompt also counts as the session moving on.

## Commit conventions

- One feature per commit, message starts with `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `refactor:`
- Push directly to `main` (no PR flow yet — single-author)
- Always: `git diff --cached` before commit, then `git add` + `git commit` + `git push` in one Bash call to keep other agents from stepping in mid-flight

## Repo links

- GitHub: <https://github.com/angelstreet/ghosty-sessions>
- Tailscale IP: `100.74.90.82`
- Tailnet: `taile677a6.ts.net`

## How to test the PWA install flow on a fresh phone

1. Join the `angelstreet` Tailscale tailnet on the phone (if not already).
2. Visit `https://100.74.90.82:7443/` in Chrome.
3. Tap **Advanced → Proceed to 100.74.90.82 (unsafe)**. Accept once.
4. The page loads → orange ↓ install icon in the topbar → tap → "Add to Home Screen" → done.
5. Launch from home screen — opens full-screen, no address bar, install button auto-hides.

## When you're done for the day

The session is named `ghosty` so you can re-attach from any box with the key:

```bash
ssh codebox 'tmux attach -t ghosty'
```

Or from the Mac:

```bash
~/bin/codebox-ghosty
```

## Manager fixes (TASK-44 readiness review)

- `aiAutoCases` defaults to `[]` (owner picks); a test pins that no default turns `owner_decision` on.
- Repeat stops: `last-stops.json` (state dir) holds the last logged stop per session, so restarts and repaints do not
  log it again; `w.moved` (real work / send / reporter prompt) lets the same words through. Only the LAST key is compared,
  so an A, B, A pattern still logs A twice.
- Outcome: reporter prompt must be newer than the stall; pane prompt must sit below the stall's closing text, else `unknown`.
- `POST /api/alert` (loopback + reporter token, 10/h) and the `by` actor field live in `api-extras.js` (server.js starts
  listening on import, so tests cover the handlers directly; `test/manager-fixes.test.js`).
- SW cache bumped to v25 (manager panel log shows `by`).
